# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of robust error handling in POST routes.  Specifically, the example shows a `/users` POST endpoint that fails silently if the request body is malformed or if a database error occurs.

The `bug.js` file contains the flawed code. The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Problem

The original code lacks validation and error handling for the user data received in the request body.  It also doesn't handle potential errors during database interaction (e.g., database connection issues, constraint violations).  This results in unhelpful 500 errors sent to the client, providing no indication of the actual cause of the failure.

## Solution

The solution includes comprehensive validation of the request body using a schema and handles potential database errors gracefully. It returns appropriate HTTP status codes and meaningful error messages to the client, enhancing the user experience and aiding debugging.
